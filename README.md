## Why Fork?
Forms are hard. Orchestrating their ever changing state, complex logic, and rich UI elements is quite a challenging task.

**Fork** tries to establish a pattern by abstracting away the bits of code that can be generalized to shift the developer's focus on the features implementation. The following points represent the pillars *Fork* was built upon:

* Control - *You code your form components*
* Adaptable - *Plug it in and take only what you need*
* Separation of concerns - *Logic and UI live in different places*
* CSS Free - *You manage the style*

It's worth to point out that from v2.0.0 this library doesn't necessarily require re-frame. In fact, you can use it exclusively with Reagent.

As at this state you must be dying of curiosity, I will dive right into the implementation details, hoping that this will help you save the day... and some nerves.



## API

### Require Fork

#### In Deps

```clojure
fork {:mvn/version "2.0.0"}
```

or

```clojure
fork {:git/url "https://github.com/luciodale/fork.git"
      :sha "sha commit"}
 ```

#### In Namespace

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require
    ;; depending on what you want to use
	[fork.re-frame :as fork]
	[fork.reagent :as fork-reagent]))
```

Note that the APIs of `fork.re-frame` and `fork.reagent` are identical, so I will be using only the former in the following examples.

### The Bare Minimum

```clojure
(defn my-form
  [{:keys [values handle-change handle-blur]}]
  [:div
   [:p "Read back: " (values "input")]
   [:input
    {:name "input"
     :value (values "input")
     :on-change handle-change
     :on-blur handle-blur}]])

(defn foo []
  [fork/form {:initial-values
              {"input" "hello"}}
   my-form])
 ```

Notice that *Fork* takes only two parameters. The first one is a map of config, and the second one is a function that returns your form component. Many API helpers are accessible as first argument of the form function that wraps your form component.

Starting from the config map, `:initial-values` might be provided to make *Fork* aware of any of your prefilled form values. Make sure to match the `:name` of your inputs with what you define in the `:initial-values` map to successfully link up the two. Do not use keywords for input names, as they are automatically cast to strings, giving you weird values like `":input"`. If you don't need to set default values for your fields, you can discard this key.

### Can I go anonymous?

You can also return your component in an anonymous function, but you have to be careful not to cause unwanted re-renderings by updating any external state. The following code is an example of what you want to avoid, when using an anonymous function:

```clojure
;;!!!!! BAD CODE !!!!!

(defn foo []
  (let [external-input (r/atom nil)]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:input
        {:value @external-input
         :on-change #(reset! external-input
                             (-> % .-target .-value))}]
       [fork/form {}
        (fn [{:keys [values
                     form-id
                     handle-change
                     handle-blur] :as props}]
          [:form
           {:id form-id}
           [:input
            {:name "name"
             :value (values "name")
             :on-change #(do (reset! external-input "some-value")
                             (handle-change %))
             :on-blur handle-blur}]])]])))

;;!!!!! BAD CODE !!!!!

```

Briefly, the `"name"` input will lose focus every time its `:on-change` event is dispatched. This happens because the handler creates a new value for the `external-input` state, which sparks the re-rendering of the whole `foo` component.

As a solution, you might keep the anonymous function in place as long as you remember to use the `foo` component exclusively for the logic related to `fork/form`.

### How do I submit a form?

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require
   [fork.re-frame :as fork]
   [re-frame.core :as rf]))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :submit-handler
 (fn [{db :db} [_ {:keys [values dirty path]}]]
   ;; dirty tells you whether the values have been touched before submitting.
   ;; Its possible values are nil or a map of changed values
   {:db (fork/set-submitting db path true)
    :dispatch-later [{:ms 1000
                      :disptach [:resolved-form path values]}]}))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :resolved-form
 (fn [{db :db} [_ path values]]
   (js/alert values)
   {:db (fork/set-submitting db path false)}))

(defn foo []
  [fork/form {:path :form
              :form-id "form-id"
              :prevent-default? true
              :clean-on-unmount? true
              :on-submit #(rf/dispatch [:submit-handler %])}
    (fn [{:keys [values
                 form-id
                 handle-change
                 handle-blur
                 submitting?
                 handle-submit]}]
      [:form
       {:id form-id
        :on-submit handle-submit}
       [:input
        {:name "input"
         :value (values "input")
         :on-change handle-change
         :on-blur handle-blur}]
       [:button
        {:type "submit"
         :disabled submitting?}
         "Submit Form"]])])
```

Let's examine what has been added step by step:

* Require Re-frame in your namespace
* Create a Re-frame effect that will be called upon submitting
* Pass the newly created effect to *Fork* along with `:path` and other options
* Destructure `handle-submit` and `submitting?` to be used in your UI
* Wrap your inputs in a form tag and add a submit button

If some parts look a bit obscure, the will be explained thoroughly in the following paragraphs.

#### Config Map

`:form-id` makes fork aware of your form elements. If it is not specified, a random id will be generated and will be provided through the same `:form-id` key.

`:path` lets you choose where to store your form global events i.e. server related stuff. MANDATORY!

`:prevent-default?` does not automatically send your form to the server on submit.

`:clean-on-unmount?` resets the state when your component is unmounted. (Useful when used with re-frame).

`:validation` to pass a validation function that gives you the form values im a map as single param.

`:initial-values` to pre-populate the inputs.

`:initial-touched` to pre-populate the inputs and set them as touched.

`:on-submit` lets you write your own submit logic. It gives you a map with `:state :path :values :dirty` keys.

`:component-did-mount` to perform any logic after the component is mounted. It takes a function and provides one argument that consists of a map of handlers: `set-touched, set-untouched, set-values, disable, enable, disabled?, handle-change, handle-blur, send-server-request`

#### The Flow

After clicking the submit button, your `:on-submit` function is invoked. Remember to set submitting? to `true` with the handler `fork/set-submitting`. After your eventual ajax call, do not forget to set the submitting? value back to false with the same handler to handle the form life cycle.

You probably want to know more than the same old *Hello World* demonstration. Hence, I have prepared a better example that includes a server request and shows better what *Fork* can do for you.

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require
   [ajax.core :as ajax]
   [day8.re-frame.http-fx]
   [fork.re-frame :as fork]
   [re-frame.core :as rf]))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :success
 (fn [{db :db} [_ result path]]
   {:db (-> db
            (assoc :result result)
            (fork/set-submitting path false)
            (fork/set-server-message path "Registration successful!"))}))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :failure
 (fn [{db :db} [_ result path]]
   {:db (-> db
            (fork/set-submitting path false)
            (fork/set-server-message path "Registration failed!"))}))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :submit-handler
 (fn [{db :db} [_ {:keys [values path]}]]
   {:db (fork/set-submitting db path true)
    :http-xhrio
    {:method :post
     :uri "/submit-form"
     :params values
     :timeout 2000
     :format (ajax/transit-request-format)
     :response-format (ajax/transit-response-format)
     :on-success [:success path]
     :on-failure [:failure path]}}))

(defn foo []
  [fork/form {:form-id "id"
              :path :form
              :prevent-default? true
              :clean-on-unmount? true
              :on-submit #(rf/dispatch [:submit-handler %])}
   (fn [{:keys [values
                form-id
                handle-change
                handle-blur
                submitting?
				on-submit-server-message
                handle-submit]}]
     [:form
      {:id form-id
       :on-submit handle-submit}
      [:input
       {:name "input"
        :value (values "input")
        :on-change handle-change
        :on-blur handle-blur}]
      [:button
       {:type "submit"
        :disabled submitting?}
       "Submit Form"]
      [:p on-submit-server-message]])])
```

### Cool, but what about validation?

Simply plug in any library of your choice that is side effect free, or build your custom validation.

#### More details

All you have to do is to pass a function that takes `values` as only parameter. The returned data will be accessible via the key `errors`, which can be destructured from the props.

Let's now build some real validation for our *Fork* component using for example the [Vlad](https://github.com/logaan/vlad) library:

```clojure
(def validation
  (vlad/join (vlad/attr ["name"]
                        (vlad/chain
                         (vlad/present)
                         (vlad/length-in 3 15)))
             (vlad/attr ["password"]
                        (vlad/chain
                         (vlad/present)
                         (vlad/length-over 7)))))
```

#### Connect the wires

Let's integrate the validation with our *Fork* component to actually display the errors:

```clojure
[fork/form {:path :form
            :form-id "id"
            :validation #(vlad/field-errors validation %)
            :prevent-default? true
            :clean-on-unmount? true
            :on-submit #(rf/dispatch [:submit-handler %])}
 (fn [{:keys [values
              form-id
              errors
              touched
              handle-change
              handle-blur
              submitting?
              handle-submit]}]
   [:form
    {:id form-id
     :on-submit handle-submit}
    [:input
     {:name "name"
      :value (values "name")
      :on-change handle-change
      :on-blur handle-blur}]
    (when (touched "name")
      [:div (first (get errors (list "name")))])
    [:input
     {:name "password"
      :value (values "password")
      :on-change handle-change
      :on-blur handle-blur}]
    (when (touched "password")
      [:div (first (get errors (list "password")))])
    [:button
     {:type "submit"
      :disabled submitting?}
     "Submit Form"]])]
```

Noticed anything new? We are simply passing the vlad validation function along with a `:validation` key and destructuring `:touched`. The latter comes in handy to improve the user experience in that the errors are not shown until the first `:on-blur` event is fired.

When a validation function is provided, the submit button will do nothing until all errors are cleared. The only variable that does change is `:submit-count`, which is incremented every time the submission is attempted.

#### Little Vlad note:

To perform `password` and `confirm-password` validation I recommend using the helper `vlad/equals-value`, as this really simplifies your logic. Briefly, you can define your validation like the following snippet:

```clojure
(def form-validation
  (fn [password]
    (vlad/join
     (vlad/attr ["password"]
                (vlad/chain (vlad/present)
                            (vlad/join (vlad/length-in 6 128))))
     (vlad/attr ["confirm-password"]
                (vlad/chain
                 (vlad/equals-value
                  password
                  {:message "Confirm Password must be same as password"}))))))
```

and pass the password value when giving the function to *Fork* i.e.

```clojure
[fork/form {:validation
            #(vlad/field-errors
              ;; passing password to the function
              (form-validation (get % "password"))
              %)
            ...}
	    ...]
```

### Dealing with server requests

Since version `1.1.0`, the handler `send-server-request` provides a way of performing server side validation `:on-blur` or `:on-change`, or any other operation that involves your backend code. Here is an example of how it works:

```clojure
(rf/reg-event-fx
 :server-request
 (fn [_ [_ props]]
   ;; faking a server request
   {:dispatch-later [{:ms 2000 :dispatch [:response props]}]}))

(rf/reg-event-fx
 :response
 (fn [{db :db} [_ {:keys [values path]}]]
   ;; so that the form can be submitted
   {:db (fork/set-waiting db path "email" false)}))

(defn foo []
  [fork/form {:path :form
              :prevent-default? true
              :on-submit #(js/alert %)}
   (fn [{:keys [form-id
                values
                handle-change
                handle-blur
                handle-submit
                send-server-request]}]
     [:div
      [:form
       {:id form-id
        :on-submit handle-submit}
       [:input
        {:name "email"
         :value (values "email")
         :on-blur handle-blur
         :on-change (fn [evt]
                      (handle-change evt)
                      (send-server-request evt
                                           #(rf/dispatch [:server-request %])
                                           ;; optional
                                           {:debounce 500}))}]
       [:button
         {:type "submit"}
        "Submit"]]])])
```

After destructuring `:send-server-request`, this function is invoked within the `:on-change` handler. It takes either two or three parameters being:

- An event - *Required*

- A function that performs the server request, taking the up to date values as argument - *Required*

- An optional map - `:debounce` and `:throttle` are both supported from `v1.2.4`

To prevent the form submission while waiting for a server response, a `:waiting? true` key value pair is stored in the state and needs to be set to false after the server logic is resolved. You can do this yourself or use `(fork/set-waiting db path "email" false)`, as shown above. Now, the form can be submitted.

### Does Fork do anything else for me?

You bet it does. The keys you can currently access from your form function are:

```clojure
[{:keys
  [db ;; <- only re-frame
   props
   state
   reset
   values
   form-id
   errors
   touched
   set-touched
   set-untouched
   submitting?
   submit-count
   set-values
   disable
   enable
   disabled?
   handle-change
   handle-blur
   handle-submit
   on-submit-server-message
   send-server-request]}]
```
#### Quick overview

Here is a demonstration on how to use the above handlers that have not been mentioned so far:

```clojure
;; db is simply the dereferenced re-frame state that fork uses for global logic

;; state is the local ratom used for the full form core logic
(swap! state assoc :something :new)

;; to remove full state
(reset)

;; to reset state to given map
(reset {:values {"name" "John"}
        :touched #{"name"}})

(set-touched "input" "another-input")

(set-untouched "input" "another-input")

(set-values {"input" "new-value"})

(set-values {"input" "new-value"
             "another-input" "new-value-too"})

(disable "input")

(disable "input" "another-input")

(enable "input")

(enable "input" "another-input")

;; input component
[:input
{...
 :disabled (disabled? "input")
 ...}]
```

For what concerns the `:props` key, you can use it as a way of passing arguments to the form component. Here is a quick example:

```clojure
(defn my-form
  [{:keys [props ...]}]
  ;; props accessible in here!
  ...
  )

(defn foo []
  [fork/form {:props {:arg1 "foo" :arg2 "bar"}
              ...}
   my-form])
```

## Do I really need to build all components from the ground up?

Certainly not, *Fork* gives you some pre-built inputs, yet you are condemning yourself to the Bulma CSS framework if you ever choose to go down that route. Creating your own wrappers would work much better, allowing you to retain full control on the style. Having said that, these are the few components that ship with *Fork*.

### Bulma CDN

The quickest way to get Bulma is to require the CSS in the header of your index.html file:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.5/css/bulma.min.css"/>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.9.0/css/all.min.css"/>
```

### Input

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require
   [fork.bulma :as bulma]))
```

```clojure
[bulma/input props
 {:name "input"
  :label "First Name"
  :placeholder "Joe"
  :type "text"
  :class "your-css-class"}]
```

To get all the props from your form function in one shot, you can add :as props just like this: `{:keys [values ..] :as props}`

### Text Area

```clojure
[bulma/textarea props
 {:name "area"
  :label "Summary"
  :placeholder "Max 400 words"
  :type "text"
  :class "your-css-class"}]
```

### Checkbox

```clojure
[bulma/checkbox props
 {:name "agree"
  :text "Plain text or component as well"}]
```

If you pass a component to `:text` such as `[:div "Some text"]`, add the `display: inline;` style to the element.

### Dropdowns

```clojure
[bulma/pretty-dropdown props
 {:label "Optional Label"
  :name "pretty-dropdown"
  :options [{"key-1" 1}
            {"key-2" 2}
            {"key-3" 3}]
  :class "Optional Css Class"}]
```

```clojure
[bulma/dropdown props
 {:label "Optional Label"
  :name "pretty-dropdown"
  :options [{"key-1" 1}
            {"key-2" 2}
            {"key-3" 3}]
  :class "Optional Css Class"}]
```

## Can I go make my forms now?

Yes you can. This documentation should get you started with *Fork* the right way so that you can be productive with it. Ideas, comments (good or bad), and suggestions are always welcome!
